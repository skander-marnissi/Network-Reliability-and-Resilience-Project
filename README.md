# Network-Reliability-and-Resilience-Project

The “Network Reliability and Resilience of Rapid Transit Systems” report, details metrics that would allow us to achieve accurate results and directs our analysis towards the most efficient thinking.

Our project hence shows the results we have been able to extract out of the obtained output and determine the reliability of its resilience. The adjacency matrix is set as our pointer in what follows.

It intelligently involves the execution of a sequence of actions to achieve a goal.

## Installation

Open cmd and type the following commands: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkanderMarnissi/Network-Reliability-and-Resilience-Project/
```

After downloading:

```bash
cd Network-Reliability-and-Resilience-Project
```

### Step 1: Then install Octave:
You can install it from: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download 


## How it works?

In this project, the final output is an evaluation of several searching algorithms.

**Note: all the context of the simulation and report are detail in the Project_Report.pdf.**

## Usage

In order to process the program and make it work you need to:

### Step 1: install the required Octave.

### Step 2: Now run Octave:

### Step 3: Import data from .Data/ directory

### Step 4: Import all the functions from .Fonctions/ directory

### Step 5: Now run the functions in order to do the evaluation.

**Note: The simulation will take time, so you have to wait 3-5 min depending on your computer resources.**
